Lab III  Array Processing

Due the Saturday after the lab meeting at 8 A.M..

Please do the following.

1. Create a Java project in Eclipse for this lab

2. In the project, create a Java class, arrayProcessingExamples.java

3. load the Eclipse file with the file with that name from this 
   archive 

4. The file has comments that discuss example methods

   private static void loadA(Scanner f)
   private static double overallChange() 
   private static double[] bestNetChange()
   private static int lengthOfLongestNegSequence()

   and the methods you are asked to code

   private static  int countPositives()
   private static double averageChange()
   private static int lengthOfLongestDeterioratingSequence()
   private static int numberOfLocalMinima()

   Those methods are all marked with

   YOU MUST CODE THIS

   
   There are eight test files included, apTD1.txt through apTD8.txt   
   and correct output for each is given at the end of them.  The
   program reads the name of the file from the command line, so
   you will need to create a run/launch configuration to read
   the data from a file.

   You should code as many of the four you are asked to code as you 
   can.  The third is more challenging than the others.

5. When you are done, identify your team members in the 
   space at the top of the Java source file and submit just that source
   code file to Blackboard.  Please do not put it in an archive file.
